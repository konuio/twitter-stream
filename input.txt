Note that applications should define a main() method instead of extending scala.App. Subclasses of scala.App may not work correctly.

We pass the SparkContext constructor a SparkConf object which contains information about our application.

Our application depends on the Spark API, so we’ll also include an sbt configuration file, simple.sbt, which explains that Spark is a dependency. This file also adds a repository that Spark depends on:
